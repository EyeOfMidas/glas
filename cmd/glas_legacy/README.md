##### Glas Legacy

Uses a raw terminal for output and a form readline for input. While functional
the input is only slightly better than that of using telnet.

For that reason the main client implementation is being developed in a console
terminal instead.

While this version should continue to work it will not be maintained and no
issues should be filed for it.
