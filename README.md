##### Glas

Is a telnet based MUD client framework. User-facing interaction is handled in
in a separate client (be it terminal or otherwise) which passes requirements
needed for Glas to run during it's start.

Front-facing client implementations are found in the [cmd](https://github.com/IngCr3at1on/glas/tree/master/cmd) directory.

Issues and pull requests are welcome but if possible please tag issues related
to the core Glas code as #Glas and client issues as #Client.
