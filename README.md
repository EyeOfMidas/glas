##### Glas

Is a telnet based MUD client framework. User-facing interaction is handled in
in a separate client (be it terminal or otherwise) which passes requirements
needed for Glas to run during it's start.

Front-facing client implementations are found in the [glas-cli](https://github.com/IngCr3at1on/glas-cli) repo.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
